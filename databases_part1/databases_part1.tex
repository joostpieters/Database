%% ==> Some hints are following:

\section{Assumptions}\label{hints}


The tax per port is not multivalued, there is only one tax-rate per port (independent from the ship type or other characteristics).\\ \\
We assume that a ship can't have more than one route simultaneously. \\ \\
To uniquely identify SHIPMENT(s) (a weak entity type) with the same shipbroker and customer, we inserted a custom ID that functions as a partial key. The attributes Weight and Volume are not sufficient, since there could exist multiple shipments with the same weight and volume.\\ \\
There is no partial key for the weak entity ROUTE, since two routes with the same ports are considered as one and the same.

\section{ER-diagram}

Still have to adjust margins of the page...
