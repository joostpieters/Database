# Database-Assignement
This is the assignment for the course Gegevensbanken/Database [B-KUL-H01O9A].
The assignment was done as a team of three students including myself. It consists of 4 phases which starts from modeling an EER diagram from the data then later on to build a database-system with the required features.
